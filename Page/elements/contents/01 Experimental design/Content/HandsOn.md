# Hand on: Experimental design and Analytical planning

 
## Case study 1: Investigating the molecular basis of Alzheimer's disease 
- Design a multi-omics study to understand the genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic changes associated with Alzheimer's disease. 
- Consider the use of techniques such as next-generation sequencing, mass spectrometry, and bioinformatics analysis to integrate data from multiple omics levels. 

## Case study 2: Characterizing the tumor microenvironment in glioblastoma 
- Develop a study design to analyze the genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic profiles of tumor cells, immune cells, and stromal cells within the glioblastoma microenvironment. 
- Consider the use of single-cell sequencing and spatial transcriptomics to capture the heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment. 

## Case study 3: Unraveling the molecular mechanisms of Parkinson's disease 
- Design a multi-omics study to identify key genetic, epigenetic, and molecular pathways involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. 
- Consider the integration of data from genomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics to gain a comprehensive understanding of the disease mechanisms. 

## Case study 4: Understanding the impact of environmental factors on brain development
- Develop a study design to investigate the effects of environmental exposures such as toxins, pollutants, and nutritional factors on the omics profiles of developing brain tissues. 
- Consider the use of longitudinal omics profiling to capture the dynamic changes in genetic, epigenetic, and molecular pathways over time. 

## Case study 5: Personalized medicine approach for brain cancer treatment 
- Design a multi-omics study to identify molecular biomarkers and therapeutic targets for individual brain cancer patients. 
- Consider the integration of genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data to guide personalized treatment strategies based on the molecular profiles of each patient's tumor.
