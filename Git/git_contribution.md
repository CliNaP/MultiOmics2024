# Pull Requests in Git

## Creating a Pull Request

After making changes in a branch, you can create a pull request to propose merging those changes into another branch.

1. Push your changes to your repository:

    ```bash
    $ git push origin <your-branch-name>
    ```

2. Visit the repository on your Git hosting service (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).

3. Create a pull request from your branch.

4. Provide a title and description for the changes.

5. Review and submit the pull request.

## Reviewing and Merging Pull Requests

When reviewing a pull request:

1. Checkout the branch locally:

    ```bash
    $ git checkout <branch-name>
    ```

2. Fetch the changes:

    ```bash
    $ git fetch origin
    ```

3. Merge the changes into your local branch:

    ```bash
    $ git merge origin/<branch-name>
    ```

4. Resolve any merge conflicts if necessary.

5. Commit the changes and push them to the repository:

    ```bash
    $ git commit -m "Merge pull request #<pull-request-number>"
    $ git push origin <branch-name>
    ```
